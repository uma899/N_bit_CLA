# N_bit_CLA

This is intended to work perfectly as a pipelined carry lookahead adder (CLA) where switching of inputs can be as fast as propagation delay of gates (it is assumed propagation delay of any operation is fixed)
This takes 5 clock cycles to compute an addition after an input is applied. But, its thoughtput will be good compared to unpipelined CLA.
